# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished up Responsive design with Bootstrap and started diving into jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Been working with FreeCodeCamp off and on for a few months now. Now it's time to get to a constance groove and get to some of the projects

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished jQuery lessions, and now have my first project, the FreeCodeCamp tribute page.

**Thoughts:** Created my Code Pen account and started with some very basic html to start with. Issue is, I've been so sporatice with FCC, I think I forgot most of the basics. Time to find a good cheat sheet, and make some progess on the page tomorrow
